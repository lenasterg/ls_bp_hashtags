ls_bp_hashtags
==============

Enables #hashtags linking within activity stream content and provides a "Popular Hashtags" widget.  Based on BuddyPress Activity Stream Hashtags (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/buddypress-activity-stream-hashtags/) but it also stores the hashtag in an extra table in order to allow other actions (Popular hashtags etc) and make lighter database queries.
